The tidyverse is a collection of packages for doing data science:

![](notebooks-tidyverse.png)

It includes a website: http://tidyverse.org and a book: http://r4ds.had.co.nz

At the heart of the tidyverse is tidy data. Every variable is a column, every row is a case.

Base R - we could use built-in functions like aggregate(), by(), ave()

Data are here for this example:

Read data via readr

```{r}
# getwd()
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
bankData <- read_delim("~/Foundation-of-the-R-Workflow-workshop-2019-09-06/Examples/data/bank-full.csv", ";")
bankData
# let us explore the data set a bit
View(bankData)# allows us to view the data set
names(bankData)  # names of the variables
dim(bankData)  # dimension (number of rows and columns)
str(bankData)  # structure of the data set
class(bankData)
head(bankData, n = 5)
tail(bankData, n = 5)
summary(bankData)
```

```{r}
hist(bankData$age,
     main = "Histogram of Age",
     xlab = "Age in Years")
```

```{r}
boxplot(bankData$age,
        main = toupper("Boxplot of Age"),
        ylab = "Age in years",
        col = "blue")
```

```{r}
d <- density(bankData$age)
plot(d, main = "Kernel density of Age")
polygon(d, col = "red", border = "blue")
```

Seven dplyr verbs & description fundamental functions of data transformation
select() select columns/variables
filter() filter rows / provides basic filtering capabilities
arrange() re-order or arrange rows /ordering data
mutate() create new columns/variables
summarise() summarise values/data by functions of choice
group_by() allows for group operations in the “split-apply-combine” concept / groups data by categorical levels
join() joining separate dataframes

The filter verb takes conditions for filtering rows based on
conditions

Subsetting Example 1
Filter

```{r}
filter(bankData, default == 'yes')
```

Subsetting Example 2
Filter

```{r}
filter(bankData, balance < 1000)
```

Subsetting Example 3

```{r}
filter(bankData, month %in% c("april", "may", "jun"), 
       default == "yes")
```

You can also extract particular rows by number using slice().

```{r}
slice(bankData, 5:10)
```

You can use the select() verb to specify which columns of a
dataset you want

Select Example 1

```{r}
select(bankData, age, job, default, balance, housing)
```

Select Example 2

```{r}
select(bankData, default:duration, contains("p"))
```

Rename verb to easily rename variables
Select Example 3 


```{r}
select(bankData, bought_option=y)
```

Rename Example

```{r}
rename(bankData, bought_option=y)
```


You can reorder your dataset based on conditions using the
arrange() verb

Arrange Example 1


```{r}
arrange(bankData, job, default)
```

Arrange Example 2

```{r}
arrange(bankData, balance, default)
```



Arrange Example 3
You can use desc() to sort in descending order.


```{r}
arrange(bankData, desc(balance), default)
```

Transformations

The mutate() verb can be used to make new columns

```{r}
mutate(bankData, "DefaultFlag" = ifelse(default == 'yes', 1, 0))
```

Transformations 2

```{r}
mutate(bankData, "BalanceByDuration" = balance/duration)
```

mutate() retains all columns. If you only want to keep the new
transforms, you can use transmute()

Transmute Example


```{r}
transmute(bankData, "BalanceByDuration" = balance/duration)
```


Summarise Data by Groups
The group_by verb creates a grouping by a categorical
variable

```{r}
args(group_by)
```

Example group_by 1


```{r}
summarise(group_by(bankData, default), Num = n())
```

Example group_by 2


```{r}
summarise(group_by(bankData, default), Ave.Balance = mean(balance))
```

Example group_by 3


```{r}
summarise(group_by(bankData, default), Ave.Balance = mean(balance), Num = n())
```


Chaining/Piping
The pipe operator %>%
Passes result on left into first argument of function on right.
Piping is not restricted to dplyr manipulation tasks

Take the hflights data set and then…Add a variable named diff that is the result of subtracting TaxiIn from TaxiOut, and then… Pick all of the rows whose diff value does not equal NA, and then… Summarise the data set with a value named avg that is the mean diff value.
hflights %>% mutate(diff=(TaxiIn-TaxiOut)) %>% filter(is.na(diff)) %>% summarise(avg=mean(diff))

Standard

```{r}
arrange(filter(select(bankData, age, job, education, default), default == 'yes'), job, education, age)
```

With Pipes

```{r}
arrange(
  filter(
    select(bankData, age, job, education, default), 
    default == 'yes'), 
  job, education, age)
```

Piping example
The pipe operator is very helpful for group by summaries


```{r}
bankData %>% 
  select(age, job, education, default) %>%
  filter(default == 'yes') %>%
  arrange(job, education, age)
```

No Pipes

```{r}
x1 <- rnorm(10)
x2 <- rnorm(10)
sqrt(sum((x1 - x2)^2))
```

With Pipes

```{r}
(x1 - x2)^2 %>% sum() %>% sqrt()
```
Pipe + group_by()
The pipe operator is very helpful for group by summaries


```{r}
bankData %>% group_by(job) %>%
  summarise(Number = n(),
            Average.Balance = mean(balance),
            Number.Defaulted = sum(default == 'yes'),
            Default.Rate = Number.Defaulted/Number)
```

Pipe and Ploting


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
bankData %>% 
  filter(job %in% c("management", "technician", "unemployed")) %>%
  group_by(job, marital) %>% 
  summarise(Counts = n() ) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = job, y = Counts, fill = marital),
           stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge')
```

Piping: Unique Values
Piping is also very helpful with identifying unique rows. You can also
use distinct() to identify unique rows and is typically used with
arrange().


```{r}
bankData %>% 
  select(job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, contact) %>%
  arrange(job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, contact) %>%
  distinct()
```


Unique Keys
You can specify variables that you only want unique values for.


```{r}
bankData %>% 
  select(job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, contact) %>%
  arrange(job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, contact) %>%
  distinct(job, marital, education)
```

Unique Keys
It will keep the first row with those particular key values.

```{r}
bankData %>% 
  select(job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, contact) %>%
  arrange(job, marital, education, desc(default), desc(housing), desc(loan), desc(contact)) %>%
  distinct(job, marital, education)
```


Multiple Columns
You can summarise or mutate multiple columns using the same
grouping variable.
summarise_each allows you to apply the same summary
function to multiple columns
mutate_each also does a similar manipulation for mutate


```{r}
help(summarise_each)

```

Summarise_each Example

```{r}
bankData %>%
  group_by(education) %>%
  summarise_each(funs(mean), balance, duration)
```

summarise_each Example 2
You can also use multiple functions.

```{r}
bankData %>%
  group_by(education) %>%
  summarise_each(funs(min, mean, max), balance, duration)
```

mutate_each Example
You can use the . to indicate where the variables go in an arbitrary
function.

```{r}
bankData %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  select(balance, duration) %>% 
  mutate_each(funs(half = ./2))
```

Additional Helper Functions
Helper functions n() and count() count the number of rows
in a group
Helper function n_distinct(vector) counts the number of
unique items in that vector

```{r}
bankData %>% 
  group_by(job, default) %>%
  summarise(education_levels = n_distinct(education))
```


tally
tally() is a shortcut for counting


```{r}
bankData %>% group_by(job) %>%
  tally()
```


Without tally()


```{r}
bankData %>% group_by(job) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
```


count
count() makes it even easier.


```{r}
bankData %>% count(job)
```



Ranking Variables
In base R, you can use rank.

```{r}
args(rank)
```

Rank Examples

```{r}
bankData %>% slice(1:10) %>% 
  transmute(Job = job,
            jobRankAvg = rank(job), 
            jobRankRow = row_number(job), 
            jobRankMin = min_rank(job),
            jobRankDense = dense_rank(job),
            jobRankPerc = percent_rank(job),
            jobRankCume = cume_dist(job))
```


Applying custom functions
You can also apply your own custom functions using do()


```{r}
set.seed(1)
df <- data.frame(
  houseID = rep(1:10, each = 10), 
  year = 1995:2004, 
  price = ifelse(runif(10 * 10) > 0.50, NA, exp(rnorm(10 * 10)))
)
head(df)
```

Grouped Tests


```{r}
bankData %>% 
  filter(marital %in% c('married', 'single')) %>% 
  group_by(job) %>% 
  do(tTest = t.test(age ~ marital, data = .)) %>%
  mutate("tTestPVal" = get("p.value",tTest), "tTestStat" = get("statistic", tTest))
```

Changing gears…
Let's take a look at a new dataset:

Data are from https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/hdi.csv

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development.

Adaption of example by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel

tidyr

A package that reshapes the layout of tabular data.

http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html

tidyr Operations

There are four fundamental functions of data tidying:

gather() takes multiple columns, and gathers them into key-value pairs: it makes “wide” data longer
spread() takes two columns (key & value) and spreads in to multiple columns, it makes “long” data wider
separate() splits a single column into multiple columns
unite() combines multiple columns into a single column



```{r}

hdi <- read_csv("https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/hdi.csv")

View(hdi)

```

Wide to long data with gather

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
hdi_long <- gather(hdi, key = year, value = hd_index, hdi_1980:hdi_2011)

View(hdi_long)

```

Let's do a little bit better…

```{r}
hdi_long2 <- hdi_long %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(str_replace(year, "hdi_", "")))

View(hdi_long2)
```

Long to wide data with spread

```{r}
hdi_wide <- spread(hdi_long2, key = year, value = hd_index)

View(hdi_wide)
```


This is just a small peak at the functions and power of the tidyverse.
